# awesome-react-app

Example React app that combines a bunch of useful things:

- Serverside rendering. Even waits for ajax requests to finish before returning page thanks to [react-async](https://github.com/andreypopp/react-async).
- Webpack with configs for dev and production.
- WebpackDevServer with hot loading so we can view code changes live in browser without a page refresh.
- [Radium](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium) for specifying style within components. No more stylesheets.
- Simple json database for prototyping (powered by [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)).
